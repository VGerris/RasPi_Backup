# RasPi_Backup

system backup for Raspberry Pi SD cards

# Why?
Regular backups are a must for any system, but especially important if you run a server which other people use. The last thing you want is server downtime due to a corrupted or dead SD card. There are many ways to do this such as with TimeShift, I am just documenting how I do it.

### Advantages
- The created `.iso` system image works with Raspi Imager. This means you can flash the same setup to multiple Pis.
- 
### Disadvantages
- The Server needs to be powered off and SD removed for the backup.
